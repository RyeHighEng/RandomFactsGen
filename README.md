# Random Fact Generator!

Simple and slightly dumb script to practice webscraping. The script automatically pulls a random fact from the specified website and texts it to specified phone number by using smtplib and gmail to text a users phone number. This only works with Koodo and Bell right now but you can make it work with any carrier.
